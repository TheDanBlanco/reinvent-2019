# Building reusable AWS CloudFormation templates

AWS CloudFormation gives you an easy way to define your infrastructure as code, but are you using it to its full potential? In this workshop, we take real-world architecture from a sandbox template to production-ready reusable code. We start by reviewing an initial template, which you update throughout the session to incorporate AWS CloudFormation features, like cross-stack references and intrinsic functions. By the end of the workshop, expect to have a set of AWS CloudFormation templates that demonstrate the same best practices used in AWS Quick Starts.

This is presented as a 300 level workshop, starting at 200 level content and quickly ramping up to 300 level content by the last two labs. 400 level users may find some of this material basic - it is meant for 200 level users to level up to 300.
